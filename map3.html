<p class="center-content">This map was a part of the second Mastery assignment. The goal of this mastery assignment was to solidify skills in utilizing the join, summarize, and calculate functions. I joined the Miami tracts data to the tracts data and exported that data as a separate file to make one polygon shapefile. I then summarized this new data to include the sum of every occupied housing per tract. I then saved that as a new file and used the add field function to add an area tab. I used the calculate geometry function to figure out the area, and then I used the calculate field to figure out the percent of occupied housing. Once this was complete, I created a choropleth map with my final data.</p>
