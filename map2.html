<pclass="center-content" Week 7's lab's purpose was gaining the understanding of the principles of thematic mapping.There are many different ways of describing spatial data in ArcGISPro. Using these maps can be vital in understanding key relationships between many different factors. This map shows the Hispanic population across the contiguous U.S. I mainly used the symbology tools in this exercise. I created a proportional symbol map and used the graduated colors option and created the cloropleth map. I used a quantile a quantile classification in order which made sure that the map keeps around the same number of states in each class.</p>
