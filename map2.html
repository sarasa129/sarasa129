<p class="center-content">Week 7's lab's purpose was gaining the understanding of the summarizing, joining, and calculating functions in ArcGIS Pro. The problem that I aimed to solve was to describe the spatial distributions of homicides by police district. The data I used described the crimes in Chicago and the Police districts. After I separated the homicides out of the crime data by using the select by attributes function, I realized this file was not in a polygon format. I joined this data to the police districts data since that file was a polygon shapefile. Next, I needed to find the spatial density, so after I added a new field for area to the attribute table, I utilized the calculate geometry function to calculate the area of each polygon. I was then able to use the calculate field function to figure out the population density. Finally, I made a choropleth map using the symbology functions.</p>
