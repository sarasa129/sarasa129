<p> Week 5's lab was to gain the understanding of the principles of thematic mapping.There are many different ways of describing spatial data in ArcGISPro. Using these maps can be vital in understanding key relationships between many different factors. My goal for this map was to show the Hispanic population across the contiguous U.S. I mainly used the symbology tools in this exercise. I created a proportional symbol map and used the graduated colors option to create the cloropleth map. I made sure to use a quantile a quantile classification in order to keep around the same number of states in each class.</p>
